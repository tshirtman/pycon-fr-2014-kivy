pycon-fr-2014-kivy
==================

slides for the kivy conference at pycon-fr 2014, app, screenshots and pdf conversion

To view the slides in their orignal form, install kivy and start main.py with python.

Captures were taken with gnome-screenshot after the presentation, hence the timestamps being different from the one during the presentation.

The pdf is just a call to "convert export/* export.pdf" (convert being from imagemagick).

Everything except fonts is licenced unter the WTFPL.
